			<h3>What's an Info-neer?</h3>
			<p>

		Sounds a bit corny, but that's what we call ourselves at Teknowrite. Concatenate Information+Engineer and you get Info-neers. The term has meaning, though. All our info-neers go through
		a rigorous training on the latest documentation delivery tools, techniques, and best practices. By sharing our knowledge, we are able to deliver what the
		customer needs.
				</div>
		<div class="Item">
			<h3>Clients</h3>
			<p>
Our clients include many of the top technology companies (HP, Yahoo!, Juniper Networks, Adobe) as well as many top Fortune 100 companies.

			<h4>Yes, I'm an Info-neer</h4>
			<h2>Olivia (Info-neer 1)</h2>

			<p>
				We started Teknowrite in the early 90s back when the internet was just taking off.
				We quickly realized that information and its delivery was going to be a major part of technology.
			<p>
				We called ourselves geeks back then, but that soon morphed into "info-neers." It's sort of a funny-sounding term but we
				take our roles very seriously. To be an info-neer at Teknowrite, you need at least one technical or
				science degree. Many of us have two technical degrees, including a number of PhDs.
			</p>
			<p>
				We specialize in creating long-term partnerships with our clients, helping companies such as HP, Yahoo! and Cisco deliver documentation that goes beyond words on a page or computer screen to create a positive customer experience.
