			<h3>Technical Writing</h3>
			<p>
				We're an  advocate of Adobe products, particularly Framemaker for document authoring. Simply put, there is no other tool for professional technical documentation.

		<h3>Onsite or Offsite</h3>


					<p>
					Many of our serivces can be performed offsite. For example, conversions to Framemaker, editing, and indexing can be done
					offsite. Onsite or offsite, we're here to provide the solution that works best for you.
					</p>

			<h3>Editing and Indexing</h3>

			<p>
				Well-edited documentation can make all the difference to your customers. We do both copy and technical editing.
				<p>Indexing is an often overlooked area of documentation. Indexes are simple to create and provide a "window" into the information contained in your documentation. They show customers you really care about details.

					<h3>PDF Linking/King Hyperlink!</h3>
					<p>
						Imagine all your PDFs linked together into a single unit. For example, you can be in one document, click a link, and open another document to the exact topic. Think of it as PDF emulating HTML browsing. This feature is not possible with any authoring tool except Framemaker. The hyperlink is king!

			<h2>We're here for you
		</h2>
			<p>

				We live in a fast-paced world where everything needs to get done today.  The Teknowrite team has the knowledge, experience and resources to handle most any need, whether it’s updating existing documentation or developing new content, in order to create a positive customer experience, improve quality and enhance employee performance.
				<p>
				We design, develop and implement creative solutions for the development, management, and maintenance of technical content.  Our services help you determine where to start-- what questions to ask-- and how to make it happen.  Our client-focused approach and national presence allow Teknowrite to provide a wide array of options, from individual on-site support to outsourcing solutions.
				</p>

				Teknowrite relies on its almost 20 years of experience and proven expertise to provide flexible and reliable solutions including:<br>
				• Creating documentation for new products<br>
				• Software documentation updates<br>

				<h2>The Teknowrite Quiz</h2>
				<p>
				Take this quiz to see how your documentation stands up.<br><br>
				• Are there typos/grammar mistakes on the first pages of text?<br>
				• Is the Table of Contents incorrect (hyperlinks don't work) or missing?<br>
				• Is the Index missing? Technical documents typically have more than one index.<br>
				• Are key terms spelled differently (e.g., settop box or set-top box or SetTop box)?<br>
				• Are the documents poorly structured and hard to navigate (no hyperlinks)?<br>
				• Are the graphics unclear, unlabled, or mislabeled?<br>
				• Does the formatting look as if someone had a "font fest" that would make Johann Gutenberg blush? FYI-- a font is the typeface and its size (e.g., Arial - 9pt), not simply the typeface (e.g., Arial) as most people commonly describe the term.<br>
				<br>
				<p>Answering Yes to two or more of these questions indicates your documenation needs work-- probably more than you realize. If you notice documentation problems, you can be sure your customers and users will notice and judge your product or service appropriately.
