			<h1>On Time</h1>
			<p>
Deadlines are critical in technology delivery. I pride myself on meeting deadlines.

			<h1>I Understand</h1>
			<p>
				I understand your technology and your special needs-- I'm an engineer.

		<div id="Item3">
			<h1>Approach</h1>
			<p>
				My approach to documentation is simple: tighten the line between sender and receiver. In other words, use the most effective technology to deliver the most accurate information in a form the receiver understands.

			<h2>Welcome to Our Company</h2>
			<p>
				Teknowrite was started in San Francisco, California, by a group of engineers with a passion for writing about technology. Our founders, Olivia Morgan and friends, had the vision to see that the new frontiers of elecronic publication would have profound effects not only on how information was delivered, but on how that information was used.
				<p>As Marshall McCluhan said-- the medium is the message. Today, the electronic medium really is part of the message-- just consider a world without the hyperlink.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever your message, we know how to deliver it in the appropriate medium, format, and style that tells users of your documentation that you are serious about the information you deliver with your product or service. Our experienced staff of writers and editors-- "Info-neers"-- have backgrounds in engineering, biological/medical sciences, and computer science.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can deliver documentation in any format, including PDF, print, online (HTML), or context-sensitive help. We even have a solution that enables browsing a PDF document set much like an online HTML experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever your documentation needs-- whether it's a conversion to Framemaker, documentation restructuring, templates and style guide creation, or simply technical writing/editing-- consider Teknowrite as your solution.
			<p>We write for technology.
			</p>
