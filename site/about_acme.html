<h4>This site demonstrates what I call the 1/2 click rule to get basically anywhere in your source tree.
<h4>All you do is mouse over until you find your destination, and click. Well, maybe not 1/2 click but 1 click. That sure beats hunting and pecking, evenutally getting lost in the tree.
<h4>I live by the 3-click rule. If it takes more than 3 clicks, you've lost the consumer of the information.
<h4>It's all done with HTML .css and javascript. Nothing fancy or third-party. Just some creativity.
<h4>Plus it reduces all the clutter. MIT professor Patrick Winston has a great lecture on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY">here</a> (31:50, the <i>Too Heavy Crime</i> as he calls it) if you're intrested in how to deliver information instead of clutter.
