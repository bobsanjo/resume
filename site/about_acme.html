<h4>This site demonstrates the 1-click rule to get to information. For example:
<h4>Mouse over ASSY INSTRUCTIONS > Mr. Potato Head > Carribean Pirate
<h4>Click the PDF to see the PDF file.
<h4>Click markdown to see the markdown formatted version of the PDF file.
<h4>Click the Video to see the video that goes with the PDF.
<h4>It's all done with HTML .css and javascript. Nothing fancy or third-party. Just some creativity.
<h4>Plus it reduces all the clutter. MIT professor Patrick Winston has a great lecture on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY">here</a> (31:50, the <i>Too Heavy Crime</i> as he calls it) if you're intrested in how to deliver information instead of clutter.
